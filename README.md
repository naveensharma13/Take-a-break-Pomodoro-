# Take-a-break-Pomodoro-
Working all the time is an awful idea. You can only cram for so long before you hit a wall, unable to do anything else.With your productivity and health at stake, it's worth making an effort to split up your work day.Take a break is my version of Pomodoro Technique. 
In my version, you can decide the amount of time you want to work. The number of sessions and the amount of break. And you are reminded of break either by going to social media or a video song.
